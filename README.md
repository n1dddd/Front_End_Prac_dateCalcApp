## My-Process

Built with Vite, React and SCSS.

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev)
- [React](https://react.dev)
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com)
- [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.dev)'
- [formik](https://formik.org)
- [yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup)
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is a calculator app component built using React and some packages. Animation was supported by react-spring. Reinforced using stateful components, and using packages alongside state-management. A conditional rendering was applied depending on state values of component.

### Continued Development

Dipped my toes in SCSS, and dynamic mobile styling. I would like to continue to learn how to organize file/code structures in the best way possible in the front end. I would like to move to a multi component, multi-page application, with a figma sketch of the website to be compeleted.
